    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons paprika</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>2 pounds round or rump steak, about 1 inch thick</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 green bell pepper, chopped</li>
        <li>2 carrots, peeled and sliced</li>
        <li>8 ounces sliced mushrooms</li>
        <li>2 (14.5 ounce) cans stewed tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh parsley</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Stir flour, kosher salt, black pepper, paprika, and garlic powder together in a small bowl. Pound steak with a meat mallet. Sprinkle meat with flour mixture on both sides and use the meat mallet to pound the mixture into the meat.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large deep skillet or Dutch oven over medium-high heat until slightly shimmering.  Add meat and cook, undisturbed, until browned and releases easily from the pan, about 3 minutes. Flip steak and cook for 2 more minutes. Remove from the pan and set aside. </li>
        <li>Add onion, bell pepper, carrots and mushrooms to the drippings in pan; cook and stir until onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in stewed tomatoes. Return steak to pan, along with any accumulated juices and bring to a simmer.  </li>
        <li>Cover, reduce heat and simmer until steak is tender, about 1 1/2 hours. Sprinkle with parsley and serve steak and tomato mixture over rice.</li>
